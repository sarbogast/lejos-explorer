This is a Java rewriting of the Explorer program you can find on nxtprograms
(http://www.nxtprograms.com/NXT2/explorer/index.html), but running on LeJOS
(http://lejos.sourceforge.net/) instead of NXT-G.

The program can still be improved, especially to play the Ooof sound when it
hits something, but I can't figure out where to put the rso file so that LeJOS
can find it.

Developed using IntelliJ IDEA on a Mac.
Be careful with LeJOS on the Mac. Use Windows to flash the firmware and note that
the USB driver can crash sometimes when uploading a program to the NXT.

A bootstrap project for working with LeJOS in IntelliJ can be found on my FTP:
